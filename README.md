# Rube Goldeberg Animation
After learning about the abilities of Greensock and using it for animation I wanted to test my understanding by creating a Rube Goldberg animation. Wikkipedia explains what a Rube Goldebrg animation is better then I can
>A Rube Goldberg machine is a contraption, invention, device or apparatus that is deliberately over-engineered or overdone to perform a very simple task in a very complicated fashion, usually including a chain reaction. The expression is named after American cartoonist and inventor Rube Goldberg (1883â€“1970).

I brainstormed the items that I wanted to animate and then the goal of the animation a few times. Realizing that animating the machine alone would take longer I chose to use svg's from the noun project. Credit for the svg's used go to:
 - Faucet by Kenneth Von Alt
 - Tea pot by Proletkult Graphic
 - Oven by Arthur Shlain
 - Parachute by Adam Zubin
 - gear by Brittany Campbell
 - Books by Creative Stall
 - Bowling Pin by Zoe Austin
 - Magnet by Mister Pixel
 - Hook used from pully by Alex Binenstock
 - Bag by Mourad Mokrane
 - Jack by Christopher T.Howlett
 - Bouncy ball by Rachel Brent
 - Office Chair by Maria de la Riva
 - Dolly by James Keuning
 - Box by Dirk Uys

I then took these peices and organized a machine to animate.
